      <h3>Next Test</h3>
      A/B tests are easy to implement thanks to tools like Optimizely and Visual Website Optimizer, but choosing what tests to make is difficult when you're limited on time and resources. Use Next Text to get feedback and direction from experts before you make your choices.<br/><br/>
      Choosing the right tests to run is key to survival for a startup. I hope to learn as much as I can through this project.<br/><br/>
